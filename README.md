HIGHRIGHT is a Chrome extension that allows students to meaningfully highlight information and consolidate all their notes on the web. We developed the problem statement "*how might we improve information uptake from online resources so that online learning is easier for students?*" As such, it is designed to allow users to save and annotate information, and categorise their notes with colours and tags. It also features a similarity checking tool that uses machine learning to help students reduce repetetive notes, to improve their study habbits.

HIGHRIGHT was designed and built for the *Accenture Tech Bootcamp 2021* in Melbourne, held across 4 days. ***HIGHRIGHT was a finalist at the Bootcamp, being awarded 3rd place.***
